# Define the principal amount in dollars
principal = 1000

# Define the annual interest rate (5%)
rate = 0.05

# Define the time in years
time = 3

# Calculate simple interest using the formula: I = P * R * T
interest = principal * rate * time

# Display the calculated interest
print("The simple interest is:", interest)
